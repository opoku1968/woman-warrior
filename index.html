    <h1>Yaa Asantewaa The Great</h1>

    <!-- p in main-->
    <p>After the deportation of Prempeh I, the British governor-general of the
    Gold Coast, Frederick Hodgson, demanded the Golden Stool, the symbol of
    the Asante nation. This disrespectful request led to a secret meeting of
    the remaining members of the Asante government at Kumasi, to discuss how
    to secure the return of their king. There was a disagreement on how to
    bring them back and also some of them were reluctant to carry on
    fighting the British. Yaa Asantewaa, who was present at this meeting,
    stood up and addressed the members of the council with these famous
    words: â€œNow I see that some of you fear to go forward to fight for our
    king. If it were in the brave days of Osei Tutu, Okomfo Anokye, and
    Opoku Ware, chiefs would not sit down to see their king to be taken away
    without firing a shot. No European could have dared speak to chiefs of
    Asante in the way the governor spoke to you this morning. Is it true
    that the bravery of Asante is no more? I cannot believe it. It cannot
    be! I must say this: if you, the men of Asante, will not go forward,
    then we will. We, the women, will. I shall call upon my fellow women. We
    will fight the white men. We will fight till the last of us falls in the
    battlefields. With this, she took on the leadership of the Ashanti
    Uprising in 1900, gaining the support of some of the other Asante
    nobility.</p>
